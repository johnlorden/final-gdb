# Developer Notes for Daily Bible Verses Web App

## WHAT TO DO:

1. ALWAYS check for React import in every component file
   - Import React explicitly in every component: `import React from 'react'`
   - This helps prevent "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useState')" errors

2. ALWAYS check for localStorage usage
   - Wrap localStorage access in a typeof window check:
   ```javascript
   if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
     localStorage.getItem('key');
   }
   ```
   - This prevents SSR/build-time errors

3. ALWAYS use StrictMode in main.tsx
   - Keep the React.StrictMode wrapper around the App component
   - This helps identify potential problems

4. NEVER nest Router components
   - Only use one BrowserRouter/Router in your application (in main.tsx)
   - Using multiple Router components will cause the error: "You cannot render a <Router> inside another <Router>"

5. SPLIT large components into smaller ones
   - Files like BibleVerseCard.tsx and SocialShareBar.tsx are too large
   - Extract functionality into custom hooks and subcomponents

6. HANDLE language fallbacks properly
   - Always provide a fallback to English when a language fails to load
   - Disable languages with invalid XML files

7. USE descriptive console.log statements for debugging
   - Add context to your logs (e.g., `console.log('Loading language:', language)`)
   - This makes troubleshooting easier

8. OPTIMIZE image exports
   - Use proper image optimization for exports and sharing

9. TEST on both light and dark themes
   - Ensure all UI elements work well in both themes

10. ALWAYS check for undefined objects before using their methods
    - Especially in static utility classes like VerseCache
    - Use null checks and optionally initialize objects before using them

## WHAT NOT TO DO:

1. DO NOT modify read-only files directly
   - For App.tsx routing changes, we need to create a PR or request access
   - Current workaround: Update main.tsx to import the routes we need

2. DO NOT use localStorage without checking for window
   - This causes build failures when localStorage is accessed during SSR

3. DO NOT leave large components without refactoring
   - BibleVerseCard.tsx is 612 lines - way too large!
   - SocialShareBar.tsx is 376 lines - needs refactoring

4. DO NOT hardcode language support
   - Always use the database for language configuration

5. DO NOT add new features without updating tests
   - All new functionality should have corresponding tests

6. DO NOT forget to update the About page
   - When adding new features, remember to update the About page

7. DO NOT leave unused imports or code
   - Clean up unused variables and imports before committing

8. DO NOT use non-responsive design
   - All UI elements must work on mobile and desktop views

9. DO NOT nest Router components
   - Only use one Router component in your app (in main.tsx)
   - Never put a Router inside App.tsx if main.tsx already has one

10. DO NOT assume objects or properties exist
    - Always check if an object exists before accessing its properties
    - Use optional chaining or conditionals to safely access properties and methods

## KNOWN ISSUES TO FIX:

1. Vercel deployment needs proper configuration
   - Current vercel.json needs validation
   - Make sure all required public files are included in the build

2. Bible Verse Card exports still have a border
   - Need to apply border: none to clonedElement when exporting

3. App.tsx route updates needed for About page
   - Need to add About page to routes

4. Language system needs to disable invalid languages
   - Add validation when loading XML files
   - Update database status when languages fail to load

5. VerseCache error with new languages
   - Fixed: Added null checks when accessing verseCaches and searchCaches
   - Added initialization for new language caches on first access
